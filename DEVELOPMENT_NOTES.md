- **Express backend** with comprehensive API endpoints
- **MongoDB Atlas** connected with complete User model
- **User search and matching system** with advanced filtering capabilities
- **Sample user data** for testing search functionality
- **Production-ready foundation** for climbing partner matching features

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:
1. **Messaging System**
   - Create chat/messaging database schema
   - Implement real-time messaging with WebSockets
   - Build messaging UI and conversation management
   - Add notifications for new messages

2. **Advanced Search Features**

   - Implement climbing history tracking
   - Create climbing achievements system
   - Add social features (following, reviews)

3. **Advanced Profile Features**
   - Add profile picture upload functionality
   - Implement climbing grade tracking
   - Create climbing history and achievements
   - Add social features (following, reviews)

4. **Core Climbing Features**
   - Gym and outdoor location management
   - Climbing trip planning and coordination
   - Safety ratings and partner verification
   - Mobile-responsive design improvements

## Technical Decisions Made:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcryptjs password hashing
- **State Management**: React Context API for authentication
- **Routing**: React Router with protected routes
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design

## Troubleshooting Notes:
- Tailwind CSS v4 had compatibility issues â†’ downgraded to v3
- PowerShell doesn't support `&&` syntax â†’ use separate commands
- PostCSS configuration needed for Tailwind integration
- MongoDB Atlas connection: Remove `<>` brackets from connection string
- Database authentication: Create new database user if auth fails
- JWT payload structure: Fixed user ID access in auth middleware
- Profile API endpoints: Updated to use /api/users/profile for complete user data
- TypeScript interfaces: Updated User interface to include all profile fields
- Route ordering: /:userId route must come after specific routes like /profile to prevent conflicts
- Authentication URLs: Use relative URLs with proxy instead of hardcoded localhost:5000
- Search script: Use TypeScript (ts-node) instead of JavaScript for ES module compatibility

## Commands Reference:
```bash
# Start React development server
cd client
npm start

# Start Express backend server
cd server
npm start

# Stop development server
Ctrl + C

# Navigate to project root
cd ..

# Install dependencies (new device setup)
cd client && npm install

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push
```

## Environment Setup:
- Create `.env` file in `server/` directory
- Add MongoDB Atlas connection string
- Format: `MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/climbing-friend-finder?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
