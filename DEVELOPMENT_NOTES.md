   - Added start scripts to package.json

5. **Database Setup**
   - Configured MongoDB Atlas connection
   - Created database configuration (config/database.ts)
   - Created comprehensive User model with climbing-specific fields
   - Set up environment variables (.env file)
   - Verified database connection working

6. **Authentication System**
   - Implemented JWT authentication with bcryptjs password hashing
   - Created authentication middleware for protected routes
   - Added user registration and login endpoints
   - Built React authentication context for state management
   - Implemented secure token storage in localStorage
   - Added automatic token validation and user persistence

7. **Frontend Authentication**
   - Created login and registration forms with validation
   - Implemented error handling and success messages
   - Added loading states and user feedback
   - Connected forms to Express API endpoints
   - Tested complete authentication flow

8. **Protected Routes & Navigation**
   - Implemented React Router with protected routes
   - Created navigation component with active states
   - Built page components (Dashboard, Profile, Search)
   - Added route guards and automatic redirects
   - Created clean URL structure and navigation flow

9. **User Profile Management**
   - Built comprehensive profile editing form
   - Implemented backend API for profile updates
   - Added dynamic gym management and availability scheduling
   - Created profile display with all user information
   - Added form validation and error handling
   - Tested complete profile management workflow

10. **Version Control**
    - Committed all major features with detailed commit messages
    - Maintained clean git history with incremental commits
    - Used descriptive commit messages with bullet points

### ðŸ”„ Current Status:
- **Complete authentication system** with JWT tokens and user persistence
- **Multi-page React application** with protected routes and navigation
- **Full user profile management** with editing capabilities
- **Express backend** with comprehensive API endpoints
- **MongoDB Atlas** connected with complete User model
- **Production-ready foundation** for climbing partner matching features

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:
1. **User Search & Matching System**
   - Implement user search API with filtering
   - Create user search interface with filters
   - Build matching algorithm based on preferences
   - Add user discovery and compatibility scoring

2. **Messaging System**
   - Create chat/messaging database schema
   - Implement real-time messaging with WebSockets
   - Build messaging UI and conversation management
   - Add notifications for new messages

3. **Advanced Profile Features**
   - Add profile picture upload functionality
   - Implement climbing grade tracking
   - Create climbing history and achievements
   - Add social features (following, reviews)

4. **Core Climbing Features**
   - Gym and outdoor location management
   - Climbing trip planning and coordination
   - Safety ratings and partner verification
   - Mobile-responsive design improvements

## Technical Decisions Made:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcryptjs password hashing
- **State Management**: React Context API for authentication
- **Routing**: React Router with protected routes
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design

## Troubleshooting Notes:
- Tailwind CSS v4 had compatibility issues â†’ downgraded to v3
- PowerShell doesn't support `&&` syntax â†’ use separate commands
- PostCSS configuration needed for Tailwind integration
- MongoDB Atlas connection: Remove `<>` brackets from connection string
- Database authentication: Create new database user if auth fails
- JWT payload structure: Fixed user ID access in auth middleware
- Profile API endpoints: Updated to use /api/users/profile for complete user data
- TypeScript interfaces: Updated User interface to include all profile fields

## Commands Reference:
```bash
# Start React development server
cd client
npm start

# Start Express backend server
cd server
npm start

# Stop development server
Ctrl + C

# Navigate to project root
cd ..

# Install dependencies (new device setup)
cd client && npm install
cd server && npm install

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push
```

## Environment Setup:
- Create `.env` file in `server/` directory
- Add MongoDB Atlas connection string
- Format: `MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/climbing-friend-finder?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
