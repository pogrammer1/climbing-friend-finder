## Technical Decisions Made:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcryptjs password hashing
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for WebSocket communication
- **State Management**: React Context API for authentication and WebSocket
- **Routing**: React Router with protected routes
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design

## Deployment Strategy:
- **Backend**: Railway, Heroku, or Vercel (recommended: Railway for easy MongoDB integration)
- **Frontend**: Vercel or Netlify (recommended: Vercel for React apps)
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (already configured)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar for profile pictures

## Troubleshooting Notes:
- Tailwind CSS v4 had compatibility issues â†’ downgraded to v3
- PowerShell doesn't support `&&` syntax â†’ use separate commands
- PostCSS configuration needed for Tailwind integration
- MongoDB Atlas connection: Remove `<>` brackets from connection string
- Database authentication: Create new database user if auth fails
- JWT payload structure: Fixed user ID access in auth middleware
- Profile API endpoints: Updated to use /api/users/profile for complete user data
- TypeScript interfaces: Updated User interface to include all profile fields
- Route ordering: /:userId route must come after specific routes like /profile to prevent conflicts
- Authentication URLs: Use relative URLs with proxy instead of hardcoded localhost:5000
- Search script: Use TypeScript (ts-node) instead of JavaScript for ES module compatibility
