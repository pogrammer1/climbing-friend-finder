# Development Notes - Climbing Friend Finder

## Project Setup Progress

### âœ… Completed Steps:
1. **Git Repository Setup**
   - Initialized git repository
   - Connected to GitHub (pogrammer1/climbing-friend-finder)
   - Added MIT license and Node.js .gitignore

2. **Project Structure**
   - Created `client/` directory for React frontend
   - Created `server/` directory for Node.js backend
   - Added professional README.md

3. **Frontend Setup**
   - Initialized React app with TypeScript template
   - Configured Tailwind CSS v3 (resolved v4 compatibility issues)
   - Added PostCSS configuration
   - Created modern UI with gradient background and card design

4. **Version Control**
   - Committed initial project structure
   - Committed Tailwind CSS setup and UI improvements

### ðŸ”„ Current Status:
- React frontend running with Tailwind CSS
- Modern UI implemented in App.tsx
- Ready to set up backend Express server

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:
1. **Backend Setup**
   - Initialize Express server with TypeScript
   - Set up basic API endpoints
   - Configure CORS for frontend communication

2. **Database Setup**
   - Choose and configure MongoDB Atlas
   - Create user schema/models
   - Set up connection

3. **Authentication**
   - Implement user registration/login
   - Add JWT or Auth0 integration

4. **Core Features**
   - User profile creation
   - Climbing preferences (grade, gym, type)
   - Matching algorithm
   - Chat/messaging system

## Technical Decisions Made:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB (planned)
- **Authentication**: JWT or Auth0 (planned)

## Troubleshooting Notes:
- Tailwind CSS v4 had compatibility issues â†’ downgraded to v3
- PowerShell doesn't support `&&` syntax â†’ use separate commands
- PostCSS configuration needed for Tailwind integration

## Commands Reference:
```bash
# Start React development server
cd client
npm start

# Stop development server
Ctrl + C

# Navigate to project root
cd ..

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push
```
